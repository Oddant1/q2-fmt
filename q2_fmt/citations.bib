              Fecal microbiota transplantation ({FMT}) has been successfully applied to treat recurrent
              Clostridium difficile
              infection in humans, but a precise method to measure which bacterial strains stably engraft in recipients and evaluate their association with clinical outcomes is lacking. We assembled a collection of {\textgreater}1,000 different bacterial strains that were cultured from the fecal samples of 22 {FMT} donors and recipients. Using our strain collection combined with metagenomic sequencing data from the same samples, we developed a statistical approach named Strainer for the detection and tracking of bacterial strains from metagenomic sequencing data. We applied Strainer to evaluate a cohort of 13 {FMT} longitudinal clinical interventions and detected stable engraftment of 71\% of donor microbiota strains in recipients up to 5 years post-{FMT}. We found that 80\% of recipient gut bacterial strains pre-{FMT} were eliminated by {FMT} and that post-{FMT} the strains present persisted up to 5 years later, together with environmentally acquired strains. Quantification of donor bacterial strain engraftment in recipients independently explained (precision 100\%, recall 95\%) the clinical outcomes (relapse or success) after initial and repeat {FMT}. We report a compendium of bacterial species and strains that consistently engraft in recipients over time that could be used in defined live biotherapeutic products as an alternative to {FMT}. Our analytical framework and Strainer can be applied to systematically evaluate either {FMT} or defined live bacterial therapeutic studies by quantification of strain engraftment in recipients.},
